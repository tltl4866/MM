# Magic Mirror

The code structure of our program is set up like a tree, with the files App.xaml and App.xaml.cs acting as our 
root. From here, all other files are working independently as leaf nodes and one can navigate in between pages 
and classes by using the global object this.Frame. The folders we have: Assets, CalendarFolder, Helpers, Music, 
etc. were added to provide background resources to all other classes to use to make their development more convenient. 
This is also where the APIs we chose to use are located.

To setup and build this code on Microsoft Visual Studios 2017, clone the git and be sure that all of the necessary NuGet
packages are included/installed. Also, it is crucial to set the Target Version of the project to the Windows 10 Fall creators
Update. After doing so, make sure the project is set to x64 and compiles on the Local Machine (the project can be set to Debug
or Release) and then you can run the program.
